                <p>The trust of our customers is also very important to us in the area of data protection and the

                <p>We would like to point out that, for the purpose of simplifying the purchase process and for the

                    with regard to the processing of the shipment or payment, but only to the extent necessary to
                    process the order or the delivery of the goods.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition, the following data is also stored by us for the purpose of contract processing:

                    transmission of credit card data to the processing banks/payment service providers for the
                    purpose of debiting the purchase price and to the transport company/shipping company
                    commissioned by us for the delivery of the goods.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>After termination of the purchase process, the data stored by us will be deleted. In the event of
                    a contract being concluded, all data from the contractual relationship will be stored until
                    expiry of the statutory retention periods. The data such as first name, surname, address, e-mail
                    address, purchased goods and date of purchase are also stored until expiry of product liability

                <p>Any personal data of the customer that goes beyond the data protection declaration described
                    above and is transmitted to vielö will not be passed on or made available to third parties
                    without the customer's separate written consent, unless this is mandatory due to legal or
                    official regulations.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Data processing is carried out on the basis of the legal provisions of § 96 Paragraph 3 TKG as
                    well as Art 6 Paragraph 1 lit a (agreement) and/or lit b (necessary for the fulfilment of the

                    fact that you have accessed our website (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored
                    on Facebook servers in the United States, even if you do not have a profile on Facebook or are
